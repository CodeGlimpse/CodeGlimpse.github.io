Python’s design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. This article will serve as an informative guide and give you a clear understanding of how to set up a Python environment.\nWindows Download Python Installation Packages Python for Windows provides various versions of Python installation packages for selection. Of course, considering that the speed of connecting to the Python official website in somewhere may be slow, I recommend using a mirror site to download the Python installation package.\nAlibaba Mirror Site USTC Mirror Site \u0026hellip;.. If you know of other mirror sites, please contact me to update them!\ninstall Python Here are a few common installation methods for Python, you can choose the one that suits you according to your needs.\nThe Simplest Manual Installation Run the installer and select the following two options: The first option installs Python with administrator privileges. The second option automatically adds Python to your system environment path (highly recommended). Click Install Now Click Close , Installation complete! Customize installation Run the installer, still recommended to select the following two options: Click Customize installation Choose optional features as needed: Documentation: Documentation and help files for installing Python. Select this option only needed pip: Python package management tool. Very important, must choose tcl/tk and IDLE: tcl/tk and IDLE are two graphical user interfaces, IDLE is Integrated Development Environment and Learning，a python IDE that comes with it. However, we recommend using Pycharm as an IDE for learning. Python test suite: Provides a set of test suites for testing Python interpreters and standard libraries. Although beginners generally do not need to use it, this kit is still very useful, it is recommended to choose it. py launcher: Ensure user starts python using python commands in the command line for all users（requires admin privileges）: Ask if choose \u0026lsquo;py launcher\u0026rsquo; for all users on the computer. Recommended to choose Click Next Choose advanced option as needed: Install Python 3.12 for all users: Generally has no effect on use, but still recommended to choose it Associate files with Python (requires the \u0026lsquo;py\u0026rsquo; launcher): Enable the system to automatically associate Python with specific file types. When double click Python script files in File Explorer, the system will automatically use the Python interpreter to run these scripts. This can be chosen as needed, but usually the file will be associated with Pycharm later on Create shortcuts for installed applications: Create desktop shortcuts. Generally, there is no need to choose Add Python to environment variables: Selecting this option adds the path to the Python interpreter to the system\u0026rsquo;s environment variables, so that the Python interpreter can be run directly from the command line without having to enter the full path. Recommended to choose Precompile standard library: Pre-compiled the Python standard library to improve the import speed of standard library modules. This can be chosen or not Download debugging symbols: Debug symbols for developers and debuggers. Choose only need Download debug binaries (requires VS 2017 or later): A binary file for debug versions for developers and debuggers. Choose only need Select the directory for installation Click Install Click Close , Complete the installation The Simplest silent installation/automatic installation Find the installation package, right-click Properties\nRecord the File Name and the installation package path in the Location. Type cmd in the bottom-left corner of the desktop to open the command prompt as an administrator Enter the following commands in sequence:\n1 2 cd C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop python-3.13.7-amd64.exe /quiet InstallAllUsers=1 PrependPath=1 Attention: Replace C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop with the installation package path from Step 2.\nReplace python-3.13.7-amd64.exe with the filename from Step 2. (don\u0026rsquo;t forget the .exe)\nAfter waiting a few minutes, check in the Start menu to see if the installation is complete.

Run the installation command:\n1 2 cd C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop python-3.13.7-amd64.exe /quiet .\\unattend.xml Verify Installation:\n1 python -V MacOS For macOS, we need to check whether the system has a pre-installed python environment.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using macOS Monterey 12.2 or earlier, you may already have Python 2.7 pre-installed. However, the latest version has been upgraded to Python 3, which has significant improvements and improved security compared to Python 2.7. Additionally, Python 2.7 is outdated and no longer officially supported If you are using macOS Monterey 12.3 or later, Apple has completely removed Python 2.7 and will need to install Python manually To check if your macOS has Python installed, open Terminal and do something like this:\nRun python --version If the version is 2.7.*, Python 2.7 is pre-installed Run python3 --version If the version is 3.x.*, Python 3 is pre-installed Note： Recent versions of macOS include a python3 command in /usr/bin/python3 that links to a usually older and incomplete version of Python provided by and for use by the Apple development tools, Xcode or the Command Line Tools for Xcode\nYou should never modify or attempt to delete this installation, as it is Apple-controlled and is used by Apple-provided or third-party software\nIf you choose to install a newer Python version from python.org, you will have two different but functional Python installations on your computer that can co-exist\nThe default installer options should ensure that its python3 will be used instead of the system python3\nHere are a few common installation methods for Python, and you can choose the one that suits you according to your needs.\nInstall Python through the official installer Download the Python installer: Visit the macOS download address on the Python official website: Python for macOS Alternatively, you can download the installer by visiting the mirror website:\nAlibaba Mirror Site USTC Mirror Site、 \u0026hellip;.. If you know of other mirror sites, please contact me to update them!\nAfter the installer is downloaded, open the Finder - find the .pkg file in the Downloads folder – double-click to open it to start the installation Clicking on the Continue button brings up the Read Me for this installer. Besides other important information, the Read Me documents which Python version is going to be installed and on what versions of macOS it is supported Clicking on Continue proceeds to display the license for Python and for other included software. You will then need to Agree to the license terms before proceeding to the next step After the license terms are accepted, the next step is the Installation Type display. For most uses, the standard set of installation operations is appropriate. If you need to customize the installation, please refer to the introduction of Windows customize installation In either case, clicking Install will begin the install process by asking permission to install new software. A macOS user name with Administrator privilege is needed as the installed Python will be available to all users of the Mac Locate and double-click the Install Certificates.command icon in the folder that pops up or find the file in /Applications/Python 3.13/ and double-click to complete the installation This will open a temporary Terminal shell window that will use the new Python to download and install SSL root certificates for its use If Successfully installed certifi and update complete appears in the terminal window, the installation is complete. Close this terminal window and the installer window\nInstall Python with Homebrew Another way to install Python on macOS is to use Homebrew. Homebrew is a third-party package manager for macOS that allows for quick application installation using Terminal, providing macOS with a Linux-like package management experience. Interestingly, Homebrew requires support for Python to work properly. Therefore, installing Homebrew requires available Python support, which is the older version of Python used by Apple\u0026rsquo;s system developer tools mentioned earlier. To install Python on macOS using Homebrew, follow these steps:\nOpen the Terminal application – Run the brew --version command to check if Homebrew is installed: If Homebrew is already installed, skip straight to step 4 If Homebrew is not installed, run the following command in Terminal to install Homebrew: 1 /bin/bash -c \u0026#34;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\u0026#34; Once you have Homebrew installed, you can use it to install Python: Run Brew Link Python or Brew Link python@3. XX (replace XX with the correct version number) - Then restart the Terminal application to make sure the application is working properly Once the installation is complete, you can run the python -–version or python3 –-version command to verify the installation Linux The simplest way to install Python on a Linux system is to use the package manager. Below are methods for installing Python with different package managers:\nDebian / Ubuntu / Mint For Debian / Ubuntu / Mint systems, Python is typically installed using the apt package manager:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 sudo apt update # Refresh the system\u0026#39;s package database to ensure you get the latest versions sudo apt upgrade # Update all installed packages to their latest versions to avoid compatibility issues sudo apt install python3 # Install Python 3 sudo apt install python3-pip # Install Python 3\u0026#39;s pip package manager sudo apt install python3-dev python3-venv build-essential # Install Python3 development tools and virtual environment sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.local # Resolve permission issues sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock # Resolve lock file issues CentOS / Fedora / Red Hat yum For older CentOS / Fedora / Red Hat systems, Python is typically installed using the yum package manager:\n1 2 3 4 5 sudo yum update # Refresh the system\u0026#39;s package database for the latest versions sudo yum install epel-release # Install the EPEL repository (optional) sudo yum install python3 # Install Python3 sudo yum clean all sudo yum repolist # Clean and validate repository configuration dnf For newer CentOS / Fedora / Red Hat systems, Python is typically installed using the dnf package manager:\n1 2 3 4 sudo dnf update # Refresh the system\u0026#39;s package database to obtain the latest versions sudo dnf install python3 # Install Python3 sudo dnf groupinstall “Development Tools” # Install development tools sudo dnf install python3-pip # Install Python3\u0026#39;s pip package manager Arch Linux For Arch Linux systems, Python is typically installed using the pacman package manager:\n1 2 sudo pacman -Syu # Refresh the system\u0026#39;s package database to obtain the latest versions sudo pacman -S python python-pip # Install Python3 and the pip package manager for Python3 SUSE / openSUSE For SUSE / openSUSE systems, Python is typically installed using the zypper package manager:\n1 2 3 sudo zypper refresh # Refresh the system\u0026#39;s package database to obtain the latest versions sudo zypper install python3 python3-pip # Install Python 3 and the pip package manager for Python 3 sudo zypper install python3-devel python3-virtualenv build-essentials # Install Python 3 development tools and virtual environments ","date":"2025-09-28T16:20:00+08:00","image":"https://blog.codeglimpse.top/en/p/python-install/banner_hu_d772e5f016378901.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.codeglimpse.top/en/p/python-install/","title":"How to Download and Install Python"},{"content":"This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme.\nHeadings The following HTML \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;—\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; elements represent six levels of section headings. \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is the highest section level while \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; is the lowest.\nH1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 Paragraph Xerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo.
